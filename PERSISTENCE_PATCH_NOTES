Deck Builder UI — Persistence Wiring (Save/Wipe/My Deck)

- Added API helpers: apiGetDeck, apiPutDeck, apiDeleteDeck using `${API_BASE}/me/:token/deck` endpoints.
- init(): now fetches saved deck from backend (if `api` & `token` query params present) and enables the "My Deck" button.
- saveDeck(): validates 20–40, then persists to backend via PUT before running the existing animation & localStorage save.
- confirmWipe(): calls DELETE to wipe remote deck; only after success does it clear UI and local state.
- No visual changes to HTML/CSS; buttons are the same (Save Deck / Wipe Deck / My Deck).
- Ownership loading already prefers `${API_BASE}/me/:token/collection` (existing code retained).
